// This header provides APIs for a basic control socket server.
// The underlying protocol is simple:
// 1. All data flow is serial client_request->server_response transactions;
//    there is no unprompted server-pushed output, and no new requests from
//    the client will be accepted until after the server response to the
//    previous request is buffered into the socket.
// 2. All messages in both directions start with an 8 byte structure defined
//    in cs.h, which encodes 1 byte as the requested command (or ack/nak on
//    response side), a 24-bit "v" value, and a 32-bit "d" value.  The purpose
//    of "v" and "d" can be customized per command or response type.  Typically
//    if a message is followed by other data, "d" is used to encode the length
//    of the data.  In the basic server info transaction, the response contains
//    the server's version in "v" and its PID in "d".

// Create a new control socket server:
// * argv0 is the original argv[0] of gdnsd, intended to use for spawning a
// replacement.
// * Most errors are fatal, but in the special case that "csc" is NULL and we
// detect the socket is already locked by another daemon instance, this
// function returns NULL.
// * If csc_p is non-NULL, *csc_p must also be non-NULL, and we will attempt
// graceful replace from the running daemon connected to *csc_p if the control
// socket lock is still held, and fall back to attempting non-replace startup
// if it is not held.  Either way, either a valid "css" will be returned or
// this function will fail fatally.  If the csc connection was used for
// replace, *csc will retain its original value.  If it was not used (we were
// able to obtain the lock normally), csc will be closed/deleted and *csc_p set
// to NULL.
