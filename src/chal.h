// domainname (up to 240 bytes total, encodes its own length within that)
// followed by exactly 43 bytes of challenge TXT data (base64url of SHA-256
// with no padding), followed by a single NUL byte (to make debug printing
// easier).
//   Note that actual dnames limit at 256 bytes total, but in order to leave room
// for legally prepending "_acme-challenge.", the whole mechanism is
// necessarily limited to authneticating domainnames up to 240 bytes long by
// our dname format's count.
//   Multiple challenges sent in a single request are simply concatenated.  The
// request's "v" field encodes the total count of challenges and the "d" field
// the total data bytes of all the concatenated challenges.
// We define a maximum sanity limit of 100 challenges per control socket
// request, and thus there's also a maximum possible legal data length
// calculated as 28400 bytes (= 100 * (240 + 44)).
