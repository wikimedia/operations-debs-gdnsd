/*
 * This header defines two data types named stats_t and stats_uint_t,
 *   and two accessor functions for stats_t.
 *
 * stats_t is used to implement an uint-like piece of data which is
 *   shared (without barriers or locking) between multiple threads
 *   and/or CPUs with the following very important caveats:
 *
 * 1) One thread is the "owner", and is the only thread performing
 *   write operations to the value within stats_t.
 * 2) Non-owner threads only read the data, using stats_get().
 * 3) The usage of the stats_t must be such that there are no data
 *   dependencies on it for correctness.  In other words: pay attention
 *   to the word "stats" in the type name; this is intended for storing
 *   and retrieving statistical data which have no bearing on correct
 *   program execution.
 * 4) Further, it's important to realize that the writes will only
 *   be seen by the non-owner threads "when the CPU feels like it".  On
 *   modern mainstream systems with reasonable cache coherency, this
 *   generally happens "pretty soon", soon enough that it doesn't matter
 *   for stats accounting.  There is no actual guarantee on when the
 *   update becomes visible in the general case, and it might *never*
 *   become visible on some exotic architectures that gdnsd doesn't
 *   care to support at this time.
 *
 * stats_uint_t is simply an regular unsigned type of some width that
 *   matches the internal width of stats_t.  You can store the result
 *   of stats_get() in such a type to cache it thread-locally for a while
 *   in cases where that makes sense.
 *
 * The width of the types currently matches uintptr_t (the width of a
 *   pointer), because most mainstream architectures are atomic for
 *   this size of aligned memory access (not atomic in the SMP sense,
 *   atomic in the "you won't read a half-updated value" sense).  We've
 *   made a special exception for x86_64 x32, because it's a
 *   reasonably-common option where pointers are 32-bit, but 64-bit
 *   atomic operations are possible.
