/***************
 * This is the Public-Domain JKISS32 PRNG implementation which I initially got
 *   from David Jones' RNG paper here:
 *   http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.jones/GoodPracticeRNG.pdf
 *   ... and then incorporated some usage/optimization hints from
 *   https://github.com/bhickey/librng
 * The actual algorithms ultimately came from George Marsaglia.  I've made
 *   cosmetic modifications (style, C99) and given it a state pointer for
 *   threading, and renamed it into the gdnsd API namespace so they can be
 *   swapped out easily later, and given them initialization from quality
 *   libsodium sources.
