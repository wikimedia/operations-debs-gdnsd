/*
 * Notes about Domain Names in general:
 * All domainnames are composed from labels.
 *
 * In the wire format:
 *  (compression is not considered here)
 *  The maximum length of a label is 63 bytes.
 *  Each label is prefixed by a length byte with a value
 *   of 1-63 inclusive.
 *  The domainname as a whole is terminated by a NUL byte (which is
 *   technically a label of length zero).
 *  The domainname for the root of the DNS is simply a NUL byte
 *   with no preceding labels.
 *  The maximum length of a domainname is 255 bytes in wire-encoded
 *   form, including the final NUL.
 *
 * In ASCII format without considering escaping:
 *  The maximum label length is still 63 bytes
 *  Labels have no explicit length prefix, and instead are
 *   separated by a single period.
 *  A final trailing dot is often used to signify that the
 *   name is fully qualified (as opposed to a name which is
 *   intended to have the local domain appended automatically).
 *  In some cases the final trailing dot is basically ignored
 *   and names are considered fully-qualified regardless.
 *  The maximum overall length is ultimately determined by the
 *   wire format, not this format, but works out to 254 in practice:
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 63   -> illegal (257 in wire form)
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 62   -> illegal (256 in wire form)
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 61   -> 253 (255 in wire form)
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 61 . -> 254 (255 in wire form)
 *    1 .  1 .. 1 .  1   -> 253 (255 in wire form) (127 1-byte labels)
 *    1 .  1 .. 1 .  1 . -> 254 (255 in wire form) (127 1-byte labels)
 *
 * Escaping in the ASCII format:
 *  RFC1035 specifies an escaping method for zonefiles in general, which
 *   allows embedding strange characters (including dots) within labels.
 *  The escapes come in two forms: "\X" and "\DDD".  In the \X case, the
 *   X character is taken to have no special meaning (e.g. "\." is a dot
 *   as part of label data, instead of as a label separator).  In the
 *   \DDD case, DDD are interpreted as a 3-digit base 10 number from the
 *   range 0-255, and the escape represents a byte of that same value
 *   (again with no special meaning).
 *  The maximum width of an escape (representing a single "real" byte)
 *   is 4 (the "\DDD" form).
 *  The maximum width of an ASCII label in escaped form is 252 (63 * 4).
 *  When considering whole domainnames, one would multiply out the label
 *   bytes, but not the separator dots.  Therefore those names which pack
 *   the maximal overall length into the minimum set of labels see the
 *   most escape-expansion.  Reusing the maximal pair above:
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 61   -> 253 (255 in wire form)
 *     ((63 + 63 + 63 + 61) * 4) + 3 = 1003
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 61 . -> 254 (255 in wire form)
 *     ((63 + 63 + 63 + 61) * 4) + 4 = 1004
 *
 * Keep in mind these are data lengths only.  If your ASCII strings are
 *  NUL-terminated, that's an extra byte.
 *
 * So to recap:
 *  ASCII with escapes:
 *   Max label storage (NUL-terminated): 252 (253)
 *   Max name storage (NUL-terminated): 1004 (1005)
 *  ASCII without escapes:
 *   Max label storage (NUL-terminated): 63 (64)
 *   Max name storage (NUL-terminated): 254 (255)
 *  Wire:
 *   Max label len: 63
 *   Max overall len: 255
 *
 * BUT:
 *  The fact that an ASCII representation of a full name
 *   fits within 1004 (1005 for ASCIIZ) bytes does *not*
 *   imply that it is legal (that it encodes to a wire
 *   format name of legal length).  This is obvious because
 *   the 1004-byte ASCII name might contain no escapes.
 * For that matter, even if escapes are not allowed and the
 *   individual labels are checked for the 63 limit, fitting
 *   within 254 (255 for ASCIIZ) doesn't imply legality
 *   either.  Example:
 *   63 . 63 . 63 . 62 -> 254 (256, illegal, in wire form)
 *
 */

/*
 * Notes on the "dname" format:
 *
 * "dname"-formatted data is the common representation of
 *  a domainname throughout the gdnsd source code.
 *
 * The first byte is always overall len of the rest of the string.
 * The rest of the string is a wire-format domainname without
 *  compression pointers.
 * A full dname should be \x00 terminated as it would be in wire form.
 * Partial dnames (in the process of being constructed, e.g. a dname
 *  for a relative name that had no trailing dot in ASCII form, before
 *  the origin is appended) are signalled by replacing the trailing \0
 *  with a trailing \xff.  These are not valid for passing as "dname"
 *  data to the core code, but are useful during intermediate stages
 *  of construction.
 * The maximum required storage size is 256 bytes for a maximally long
 *  name.  e.g. ("uint8_t dname[256];" or "uint8_t* dname = xmalloc(256);").
 * As a general rule, all generic dname storage a plugin creates should
 *  be allocated for the full 256 bytes if you are going to construct
 *  them using the helper functions here.  However, keep in mind that
 *  constant dname arguments passed down from the core code could be
 *  (and often are) allocated to their exact size. (e.g. 2 bytes for the
 *  first example below).
 * Examples:
 *  "." -> \x01\x00
 *  "com." -> \x05\x03com\x00
 *  "a.com." -> \x07\x01a\x03com\x00
 *  "www" -> \x05\x03www\xff (not yet fully qualified)
