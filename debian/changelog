gdnsd (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream release.
    - Fixes CVE-2019-13952. (Closes: #932407)
    - Plugins cannot be built externally anymore; drop the gdnsd-dev package.
    - Add new build dependency on libsodium-dev.
    - Add build dependency on libnet-dns-perl and drop the embedded copy.
    - Drop build dependency on libwww-perl, not needed anymore.
    - Add new copyright stanza for src/kdf_compat.c.
    - Remove lib* plugins, everything is in /usr/sbin/gdnsd now.
    - Add lintian-override for gdnsd-plugin-* manpages.
    - Ship new binary /usr/bin/gdnsdctl.
  * Support zero downtime upgrades: add code to postinst to allow upgrades to
    happen with a native binary replace, rather than a stop/start. This only
    applies for upgrades from here on; an upgrade from 2.x will require a
    restart.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.5.1.
  * Bump debhelper compat to 13.
  * Remove versioned depends on libmaxminddb-dev, as minimum version is now
    satisfied in oldstable.
  * Use upstream Makefile to install all files, rather than installing to
    debian/tmp and cherry-picking files to the (now sole) gdnsd binary
    package.
  * Drop our own copy of the systemd service and use upstream's instead.
  * Switch runtime directory from /var/run to /run.
  * Remove SysV init script: due to upstream changes, running with an init
    script requires a significant extra effort and additional dependencies.
    Thus, and per the 2019 init systems GR, support only systems with systemd
    as their init system.
  * Add --with-systemdsystemunitdir to configure, to avoid extra build
    dependencies on systemd and pkg-config.
  * Support building without (fake)root (Rules-Requires-Root: no).
  * Add support for the "nocheck" build profile, that skips the installation
    of the Perl build dependencies and the execution of the suite itself.
  * Add more autopkgtests:
    - Add "isolation-container" to the "daemon" test, due to the network port.
    - Enhance the existing, simple "daemon" test to also run gdnsdctl.
    - Add a "common-operations" test, that uses "dig" to resolve hostnames,
      and validates that "gdnsdctl reload-zones" and "gdnsdctl replace" work.
    - Add a "testsuite" test, that runs the upstream test suite against the
      installed binary.
  * Update debian/copyright:
    - Adjust years to include up to 2021.
    - Point to GPL-3, not GPL (copyright-refers-to-symlink-license).
  * Add upstream metadata.
  * Update a couple of links to https (from http).
  * Update debian/watch to v4.
  * Drop "unapply-patches" from debian/source/local-options.
  * Update git layout and gbp.conf for a DEP-14/"gbp import-orig" workflow.

gdnsd (2.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream point release.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.3.0, no changes needed.
  * Build-Depend on debhelper 11~ to ease backports.
  * Drop [linux-any] from liburcu-dev Build-Depends, as it's now available on
    kFreeBSD.
  * Add 2019 to debian/copyright years.
  * Misc source package changes:
    - Drop overlay/tarballs/build-area from gbp.conf.
    - Remove custom compression setting from source/options.
    - Sort Build-Depends.

gdnsd (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Remove patch net-dns-remove-dnssec, addressed upstream.
  * Fix Vcs-Git to point to the package's GitHub page, instead of upstream's.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 11.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.3.
    - Bump gdnsd-dev's priority to optional, as extra is now deprecated.
  * Remove dbgsym-migration compatibility stanza for versions released before
    the stretch release (as only n+1 upgrades are supported).

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Dec 2017 17:00:36 +0200

gdnsd (2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libmaxminddb >= 1.2.0. This is not strictly needed, but
    building with lower versions means that we depened on the library's
    internals which are known to not be ABI-safe with newer versions.
  * Address incompatibility with newer versions of Net::DNS (libnet-dns-perl).
    Net::DNS::RR:SIG was found in the system copy, but others like
    Net::DNS::RR:NXT were not, resulting in an FTBFS. (Closes: #830184)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8.
  * Pass -O--dbgsym-migration to dh_strip and relax the debhelper dependency
    to ease backports.

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jul 2016 19:43:30 +0300

gdnsd (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Falls back from F_OFD_SETLK to F_SETLK at runtime if the runtime
      environment differs from the compile-time one. (Closes: #805571)
    - Fixes incompatibilities with libmaxminddb 1.1.5.
    - Fixes reproducibility issues (embedded hostname/build date).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7, no changes needed.
  * Upstream is signing their releases starting with 2.2.3; add Brandon's GPG
    key to debian/upstream/signing-key.asc and adjust debian/watch to check
    for the .asc.
  * Migrate from our own -dbg package to the automatic -dbgsym package.
  * Adjust libunwind-dev's architecture set: drop ia64; add mipsel, mips64el.

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Mar 2016 05:07:55 +0200

gdnsd (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Add build-dependency on libmaxminddb-dev for GeoIP2 support.
  * Add build-dependency on libunwind-dev for stacktraces on fatals.
  * Remove build-dep on geoip-database. It was only used for running the test
    suite, which now expects specific versions of the GeoIP databases.
  * Remove XS-Testsuite header, obsolete since dpkg 1.17.11.
  * Add /var/lib/gdnsd to debian/dirs.
  * Add several security options to the systemd unit file, inherited from
    upstream's own unit file.

gdnsd (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

gdnsd (1.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes test suite failure when building as root. (Closes: #711872)
  * Update Homepage field & watch file to point to the new homepage.
  * Add rudimentary dep8/autopkgtest test. The build-time test suite is
    thorough enough, this makes sure the daemon starts on package install.

gdnsd (1.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes FTBFS on sparc64, thanks to Aurelien Jarno for the help.
    - Test suite more resilient to slow build hosts, helps with a couple of
      FTBFS on slow architectures (e.g. sh4).

    Net::DNS versions broke the internal API, gdnsd now bundles parts of 0.68
    for the test suite.
  * Switch liburcu-dev build-dependency to linux-any as it was fixed in the
    meantime.

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Sat, 01 Jun 2013 18:14:02 +0300

  * Build-Depends on liburcu-dev only on the subset of architectures liburcu
    supports.
