=head1 NAME

gdnsd-plugin-null - gdnsd null plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example null service_types config:

  service_types => {
    my_null_mon => {
      plugin => null,
      # ... other generic service_type params
    }
  }

Zonefile RRs using null resolution

  foo 300 DYNA null
  bar 300 DYNC null!whatever

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gdnsd-plugin-null> exists mostly as an example of the minimum
possible plugin of both types.  It is simultaneously both a
monitoring plugin and a resolution plugin.

When used as a resolution plugin in C<DNYA> or C<DYNC> RRs, it
ignores any resource name provided.  It always returns the IPv4 address
C<0.0.0.0> and the IPv6 address C<::>.

When used as a monitoring plugin by defining a service_type as
shown in the example above it emulates the behavior of a real
monitoring plugin (updating at correct intervals, etc) but
sends a C<DOWN> result at every monitoring check interval without
actually checking anything.
